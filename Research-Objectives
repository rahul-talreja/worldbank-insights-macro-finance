Research Objectives:
How does a nation's socioeconomic indicators influence the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI) it receives, and what is the subsequent impact on its gross domestic product (GDP) growth?
 
Time Series Analysis
How do GDP per capita growth and employment rates change over time across different income-level countries?
(Understanding economic trends across income groups can provide insights into FDI attractiveness.)
How do seasonal patterns in trade balances impact GDP growth across different regions?(Trade balance fluctuations can influence investor confidence and capital inflows.)
Hypothesis Testing
Is there a significant difference in GDP growth between countries with high and low external debt? (T-Test)
(Debt levels can impact investor confidence and subsequent GDP performance.)
Do countries with higher social spending exhibit better economic stability? (F-Test)
(Economic stability is a key factor influencing FDI decisions.)
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
What are the key predictors of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in developing economies?
(Directly aligns with understanding which socioeconomic factors influence FDI.)
How do inflation rate, trade balance, and public debt impact GDP per capita growth?
(These economic factors can shape investor confidence and, in turn, GDP growth.)
How do debt servicing costs and exchange rates influence investment inflows?
(Understanding the macroeconomic conditions that affect FDI.)
How does domestic and external debt impact GDP growth?
(Debt levels can influence both investor decisions and economic growth trajectories.)
Classification
Can we classify countries into high-growth vs. low-growth economies based on GDP trends? (Logistic Regression)
(Identifying economic patterns that could influence FDI attractiveness.)
Can debt-to-GDP ratios and employment growth be used to predict whether a country is a developed, emerging, or developing economy? (Decision Tree)
(Economic classification can help in analyzing how FDI varies across different development stages.)
Clustering
Are there distinct clusters of countries based on economic growth, public debt levels, and trade balance? (K-Means Clustering)
(Grouping similar economies can provide insights into FDI trends.)
Neural Networks
Can we predict GDP growth based on debt levels? (ANN)
(Understanding how debt influences GDP growth, which in turn affects FDI decisions.)
Can a neural network model predict GDP growth more accurately than a traditional regression model?
(More precise modeling of GDP growth to understand FDI impact.)
